                    provisions as they set forth the rules and terms of using the NextKey Litigation Website.
                    <p />
                <p>
                    We are not lawyers or a law firm but rather a marketing company that assist specific
                    lawyers, law firms and others to obtain potential case leads. NextKey Litigation runs
                    media advertisements in the United States with the goal of providing personal injury
                    victims an opportunity to learn about various lawyers and law firms that are actively
                    involved in Personal Injury Law Practice in their area. This allows claimants the chance
                    to compare firms and then select the lawyers/law firm they may want to represent them.
                    By its very nature, this is an Interstate Commerce matter and Viewer acknowledges that
                    this Website evidences business transactions involving Interstate Commerce. Since
                    NextKey Litigation and Viewers of this Website agree to resolve any dispute through
                    binding arbitration, the Federal Arbitration Act FAA), 9 USC §1 et seq., shall govern the
                    interpretation, enforcement of such proceedings; See paragraph 25 below.
                    <p />
                <p>
                    Therefore, any dispute arising out of the services rendered and the use of this Website
                    shall be decided by Binding Arbitration; See Paragraph 25 below. Also, THE PARTIES
                    WAIVE THE RIGHT OF JURY TRIAL; AND FURTHER WAIVE ANY RIGHT THAT IT
                    MAY HAVE TO ASSERT THE DEFENSE OF FORUM NON-CONVENIENS.
                    <p />
                <p>
                    Many Viewers of this Website aka potential Claimants, may employ lawyers, law firms
                    and others after using our Website. However, such law firms are separate and
                    independent from us with their own Websites, agreements and terms. As we are not
                    related entities, you will have to review their sites and agreements to understand their
                    Policies and Terms. In the normal course of business, most Viewers/claimants will
                    quickly be given the names of law firms from which they may choose to employ as their
                    attorney. As a consequence, NextKey Litigation will have only a small amount of
                    personal data obtained from potential Claimants and all or most of that data will
                    promptly be made available to those law firms. That data will not be considered
                    Confidential as to those law firms, NextKey Litigation, call centers or other entities
                    involved in this process. More detailed information can be found in our Privacy Policy,

                                <p><strong>This is an Advertisement for legal services.</strong> The hiring of a lawyer
                                    is an important decision that should not be based solely upon advertisements. No
                                    representation is made that the quality of legal services to be performed is greater
                                    than the quality of legal services performed by other lawyers. Do not use this site
                                    as a substitute for seeking your own legal advice or making your own investigation
                                    of facts. Again, this is an advertisement.</p>
                                <p>Information from this website or data provided to the sites is not subject to the
                                    attorney-client privileged (we are not attorneys) and does not constitute legal
                                    advice. The transfer of such data to a law firm does not create an attorney-client
                                    relationship with such a firm which will only happen when a Retainer Agreement is
                                    signed by you with a law firm. Any initial information provided to NextKey
                                    Litigation is done so voluntarily and will not be considered nor treated as
                                    confidential.</p>

                                    and all other firm details have been provided by each law firm on their own accord.
                                    NextKey Litigation does not guarantee the accuracy of any information provided but
                                    believes it to be accurate.</p>
                                <p>All fees listed are represented as contingency fees, although clients may still be
                                    responsible for payment or reimbursement of costs and expenses, such as court filing
                                    fees, deposition costs, etc. Attorney reimbursements vary between law firms and will
                                    be detailed and outlined in any contracts you sign with a particular firm.</p>
                                <p>Note that the calculation of Law Firm reimbursements may be done in different ways so
                                    you should ask any counsel that you select to first explain their method of
                                    calculation and ask them to answer any other questions you might have before you
                                    enter into a written contract with such Law Firm. Also, such Law Firm data may
                                    change from time to time and while we may attempt to update such information no

                    </li>
                    <li>WEBSITE ATTORNEYS ARE SEPARATE FROM NEXTKEY LITIGATION. All
                        attorneys retained from this service are independent contractors that are separate and
                        not a part of Company. Company believes that they are qualified to act as legal counsel
                        in the subject matter they are employed in but Company has not made an investigation
                        in all related aspects in law that may apply to any given case. Under Texas Law
                        attorneys must disclose to their clients if they do not have Professional Liability
                        Insurance. NextKey Litigation encourages clients to discuss such matters with their
                        legal counsel. In other states potential clients should make an inquiry of any potential

                        attorney if they have such insurance. Company cannot guarantee the result of any given
                        case and as noted herein (but not repeated here) Company assumes no liability with
                        respect to any case or matter.</li>
                    <li>OTHER SITES. Company has no control over, and no liability for any third party

                        Internet sites may be linked with the Site. Because neither Company nor the Site has
                        control over the content and performance of these partner and affiliate sites, Company
                        makes no guarantees about the accuracy, currency, content, or quality of the
                        information provided by such sites, and Company assumes no responsibility for
                        unintended, objectionable, inaccurate, misleading, or unlawful content that may reside
                        on those sites. Similarly, from time to time in connection with your use of the Site, you
                        may have access to content items (including, but not limited to, websites) that are

                            continue until sufficient notice to establish a new agreement occurs. You should

                                privacy, or other right of any person or entity; (vi) any misrepresentation made by you;
                                and (vii) the Covered Parties&#39; use of the information that you submit to us
                                (including
                                your User-Generated Content) (all of the foregoing, &quot;Claims and Losses&quot;). You
                                will

                                cooperate as fully required by the Covered Parties in the defense of any Claim and
                                Losses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Parties retain the exclusive right to
                                settle, compromise, and pay any and all Claims and Losses. The Covered Parties
                                reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any Claims and
                                Losses. You will not settle any Claims and Losses without, in each instance, the prior
                                written consent of an officer of a Covered Party. The indemnity does not apply to events
                                arising directly from an attorney-client relationship, if any, that may be entered
                                between
                                you and the Company on the terms described herein.</li>
                            <li>Operation of Websites; Availability of Products and Services; International
                                Issues. The Company controls and operates the websites from its U.S.-based offices in
                                the U.S.A., and the Company makes no representation that the websites are
                                appropriate or available for use beyond the U.S.A. If you use the websites from other
                                locations, you are doing so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance
                                with applicable local laws regarding your online conduct and acceptable content, if and
                                to the extent local laws apply.</li>
                            <li>Severability; Interpretation. If any provision of these Terms is for any reason
                                deemed invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent
                                jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms, and the
                                invalidity of the provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the
                                remainder of
                                these Terms (which will remain in full force and effect). To the extent permitted by
                                applicable law, you agree to waive, and you hereby waive, any applicable statutory and
                                common law that may permit a contract to be construed against its drafter. Wherever
                                the word &quot;including&quot; is used in these Terms, the word will be deemed to mean
                                &quot;including, without limitation&quot;. The summaries of provisions and section
                                headings are
                                provided for convenience only and shall not limit the full Terms.</li>
                            <li>Communications. When you communicate with us electronically, such as via
                                e-mail and text message, you consent to receive communications from us electronically.
                                Please note that we are not obligated to respond to inquiries that we receive. You agree
                                that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to
                                you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.
                            </li>
                            <li>Investigations; Cooperation with Law Enforcement; Termination; Survival. The
                                Company reserves the right, without any limitation, to: (i) investigate any suspected
                                breaches of its websites&#39; security or its information technology or other systems or
                                networks, (ii) investigate any suspected breaches of these Terms,(iii) investigate any
                                information obtained by the Company in connection with reviewing law enforcement

                                except
                                as may be expressly set forth in any additional terms, suspend or terminate your access
                                to it, in whole or in part, including any user Accounts or registrations, at any time,
                                without notice, for any reason and without any obligation to you or any third party. Any

                                suspension or termination will not affect your obligations to the Company under these
                                Terms or any Additional Terms. Upon suspension or termination of your access to the
                                websites, or upon notice from the Company, all rights granted to you under these Terms
                                will cease immediately, and you agree that you will immediately discontinue use of the
                                websites. The provisions of these Terms, which by their nature should survive your
                                suspension or termination will survive, including the rights and licenses you grant to
                                the
                                Company in these Terms, as well as the indemnities, releases, disclaimers, and
                                limitations on liability and the provisions regarding jurisdiction, choice of law, no
                                class
                                action, and mandatory arbitration.</li>
                            <li>Assignment. The Company may assign its rights and obligations under these
                                Terms, in whole or in part, but only in writing, to any party at any time without any
                                notice.
                                The Terms and Conditions herein may not be assigned by you, and you may not

                                Company.</li>
                            <li>No Waiver. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, (i) no failure or delay
                                by the Company in exercising any of rights, powers, or remedies will operate as a
                                waiver of that or any other right, power, or remedy, and (ii) no waiver or modification
                                of
                                any provision contained in the Terms &amp; Conditions will be effective against Company
